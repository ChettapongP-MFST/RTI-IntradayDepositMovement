# RTI Intraday Deposit Movement

**Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence — Pattern B**
ADLS Gen2 → Fabric Data Pipeline (event-triggered) → Eventhouse (KQL DB) → Power BI → Activator → MS Teams

A modular, hands-on workshop series that builds a near-real-time intraday deposit monitoring solution on Microsoft Fabric using **Pattern B** (Eventhouse-centric RTI). Designed to be completed sequentially from Workshop 00 to Workshop 09.

> 🖱️ **Portal-first design** — every workshop is written for **analyst end-users** working in a browser (Azure Portal + Fabric Portal + Power BI). No Azure CLI or PowerShell is required for the happy path. The `scripts/` folders retain optional automation for platform engineers.

## The Story

A retail bank needs **near real-time visibility** into intraday deposit movements (credits, debits, net flows) across channels (ATM, BCMS, ENET) and products. CSV extracts land in ADLS Gen2 every **10 minutes**. The operations team needs:

- Dashboards that refresh within a minute
- Automated alerts to Teams when large net outflows or ingestion failures occur
- Full auditability of which file produced which rows (system columns)

This workshop series walks through building that solution end-to-end.

## Target Architecture

![Target architecture — ADLS Gen2 → Pipeline → Eventhouse → Power BI / Activator → MS Teams, all on OneLake](images/Target%20Architecture.png)

**Flow** — `Connect` (ADLS Gen2) → `Ingest & Process` (Fabric Data Pipeline, event-triggered) → `Analyse & Transform` (Eventhouse / KQL DB) → `Visualize & Act` (Power BI report + Activator) → `Get assisted & Interact` (MS Teams). All Fabric items are backed by **OneLake**.

Key design principles:

- **Event-driven**: `Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated` triggers the pipeline immediately when a file lands.
- **Idempotent**: `dbo.ProcessedFiles` control table in a Fabric Warehouse + KQL `ingest-by` tag prevent duplicate loads.
- **Traceable**: Every business row carries four **system columns** — `load_ts`, `file_name`, `pipeline_name`, `pipeline_runid` — injected by the pipeline.
- **Secured**: ADLS Gen2 firewalled; Fabric reaches it via **Trusted Workspace Access** (resource instance rule).

## Fabric RTI Architecture Patterns — Overview & Comparison

Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence supports several architecture patterns. This section compares them and explains why **Pattern B** was chosen for this use case.

### Pattern A — Streaming (Kafka / Event Hubs → Eventstream → Eventhouse)

![Pattern A — Kafka → Eventstream → Eventhouse → Power BI / Activator → Teams](images/Architecture_Pattern_A.png)

- **Source:** true streaming — Kafka, Event Hubs, IoT Hub, MQTT, CDC feeds, Pub/Sub.
- **Ingest:** no-code Eventstream (filter / aggregate / join in-flight).
- **Store:** Eventhouse / KQL DB.
- **Latency:** ~1–5 seconds source → queryable.
- **Best for:** IoT telemetry, clickstream, fraud, logs, AI/agent telemetry, content-safety signals.
- **Trade-off:** highest throughput & lowest latency, but continuous CU consumption and a Kafka-compatible producer is required.

### Pattern B — Event-driven Batch (ADLS Gen2 → Pipeline → Eventhouse) ⭐ *(this repo)*

![Pattern B — ADLS Gen2 → Data Pipeline → Eventhouse → Power BI / Activator → Teams](images/Architecture_Pattern_B.png)

- **Source:** files (CSV / JSON / Parquet) landing in ADLS Gen2 or OneLake.
- **Ingest:** Data Pipeline triggered by `Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated`.
- **Store:** Eventhouse / KQL DB.
- **Latency:** ~15–60 seconds file-land → Power BI.
- **Best for:** scheduled / semi-batch extracts (5/10/15/30-min drops), core-banking / ERP exports, bank intraday monitoring.
- **Trade-off:** pay-per-run (very low idle cost) + full ETL control (Lookup / If / Copy) + easy system-column traceability — but not suited for sub-second latency.

### Pattern C — Event-driven Batch (ADLS Gen2 → Pipeline → Lakehouse)

![Pattern C — ADLS Gen2 → Data Pipeline → Lakehouse → Power BI / Activator → Teams](images/Architecture_Pattern_C.png)

- **Source:** same as Pattern B.
- **Store:** **Lakehouse** (Delta Lake + SQL endpoint).
- **Latency:** ~1–10 minutes (Delta commit + caching).
- **Best for:** historical warehouse, medallion architecture, large dim joins, ML feature stores, data marts.
- **Trade-off:** not optimized for hot-path time-series queries; Power BI 30-s APR is not practical over Lakehouse.

### Reference Architecture — "Everything together"

![RTI Reference Architecture — full surface with Real-Time Dashboard, KQL Queryset, Copilot, Data Agent](images/Referance_Architecture.png)

A superset showing Eventstream + Eventhouse feeding **all four serving surfaces** (Power BI Report, Real-Time Dashboard, KQL Queryset) plus Activator + Copilot + Data Agent + Operations Agent. Use it as the long-term target and pick A/B/C subsets per workload.

### Side-by-side comparison

| Criterion | Pattern A (Stream) | **Pattern B (File-event)** ⭐ | Pattern C (Lakehouse) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source shape | Continuous stream | Files on cadence | Files on cadence |
| Typical source | Kafka / EH / IoT / CDC | ADLS CSV / JSON / Parquet | ADLS CSV / JSON / Parquet |
| Ingest tool | Eventstream | **Data Pipeline** | Data Pipeline |
| Landing store | Eventhouse (KQL) | **Eventhouse (KQL)** | Lakehouse (Delta) |
| End-to-end latency | 1–5 s | **15–60 s** | 1–10 min |
| Hot query (point / filter) | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⚡⚡ |
| Power BI APR ≤ 30 s | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| ETL control (dedup / audit / retry) | Medium | **High** | High |
| File-level idempotency | Complex | **Native** (`ingest-by` + control table) | Manual MERGE |
| Cost at rest | $$$ | **$** | $$ |
| Ops skill required | Streaming engineer | **Data engineer** | Lake engineer |
| System columns per file | Harder | **Trivial** (pipeline params) | Moderate |

### Recommendation — why Pattern B fits this use case best

The business scenario is: **core-banking extracts land every 10 minutes as CSV in ADLS Gen2**; operations needs dashboards refreshing within a minute and Teams alerts on anomalies.

1. **Source reality** — the upstream is file-based, not streaming. Forcing Kafka (Pattern A) would be a costly retrofit.
2. **Latency SLA** — ops need < 1 min; Pattern B delivers 15–60 s comfortably. Pattern A's 1-sec latency exceeds the SLA at higher cost; Pattern C's 1–10 min may miss it.
3. **Cost** — Pattern B pays only on file arrival (~144 runs/day), orders of magnitude cheaper than a continuous Eventstream.
4. **Governance & audit** — banks need "which file produced which rows". Pipelines give this natively via the `dbo.ProcessedFiles` control table (Fabric Warehouse, queryable via T-SQL) + system columns on the KQL business table.
5. **Idempotency** — `Get Metadata → Lookup → If → Copy (ingest-by tag)` is the canonical pattern and maps 1-to-1 to Pattern B.
6. **Operational simplicity** — existing data engineers already know pipelines; no new streaming runtime to operate.
7. **Hot query path preserved** — KQL still powers 30-s Power BI APR and sub-second Activator evaluation.

### 🧭 When to evolve

| Future trigger | Move to |
|---|---|
| Upstream begins emitting Kafka / Event Hubs | Pattern A |
| File cadence < 1 min or SLA < 5 s | Pattern A |
| Need long-term cross-domain joins (customer MDM, ML features) | Hybrid — enable **OneLake availability** on the Eventhouse so data is simultaneously queryable as Delta |
| Add Copilot / Data Agent / Operations Agent | Reference Architecture |

The **balanced hybrid**: once Pattern B is running, turn on OneLake availability on the KQL table. You get Pattern B's hot path **and** Pattern C's lake access from a single source of truth — no ingestion refactor required.

## Data Model

**`DepositMovement`** (business table, 16 columns):

| Category | Type | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| Grain | Data column | `Date`, `Time` |
| Dimensions | Data column | `Product`, `Channel`, `Channel_Group`, `Transaction_Type` |
| Measures | Data column | `Credit_Amount`, `Debit_Amount`, `Net_Amount`, `Credit_Txn`, `Debit_Txn`, `Total_Txn` |
| Lineage | System column | `load_ts`, `file_name`, `pipeline_name`, `pipeline_runid` |

**`wh_control_framework.dbo.ProcessedFiles`** (audit/control table, Fabric Warehouse, 8 columns):

`FileName`, `IngestedAtUtc`, `RowCount_`, `Status` (Success / Failed / Skipped-Duplicate), `PipelineName`, `PipelineRunId`, `RunAsUser`, `ErrorMsg`

> The control table lives in a **Fabric Warehouse** (not the Eventhouse) so analysts can query it with standard T-SQL, join it easily in Power BI, and keep the hot-path KQL table focused on business facts.
