# Workshop 02 — Eventhouse (KQL) + Warehouse (Control Table)

Create two Fabric items:

1. An **Eventhouse / KQL Database** for the hot-path business table `DepositMovement` (low-latency ingestion & query).
2. A **Fabric Warehouse** for the audit/control table `dbo.ProcessedFiles` (T-SQL friendly, easy to join in Power BI, decoupled from the hot path).

**Prerequisite:** [Workshop 01](../01-provision-adls-gen2/) complete
**Next:** [Workshop 03 — Create the Summary Table](../03-create-summary-table/)

---

## 2.1 Create the Eventhouse

1. Open the Fabric workspace (from Workshop 00.3).
2. **+ New item** → **Eventhouse** → name it `eh-rti-deposit`.
3. Inside the Eventhouse, the default KQL Database is created. Create (or rename to) a KQL Database named `DepositMovement`.

## 2.2 Create the business table (KQL)

Open the KQL Database → **Query** pane and run:

- [kql/01-create-DepositMovement.kql](kql/01-create-DepositMovement.kql)

This script does **three things**. Let's walk through each one before you execute.

### 2.2.1 Table creation (16 columns)

The table has 16 columns split into **data columns** (from the CSV) and **system columns** (injected by the pipeline):

| Category | Type | Columns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Grain | **Data column** | `Date`, `Time` | Business date and 30-minute time slot (e.g., `00:00-00:30`) |
| Dimensions | **Data column** | `Product`, `Channel`, `Channel_Group`, `Transaction_Type` | Slicing attributes for analysis |
| Measures | **Data column** | `Credit_Amount`, `Debit_Amount`, `Net_Amount`, `Credit_Txn`, `Debit_Txn`, `Total_Txn` | Numeric values for aggregation |
| Lineage | **System column** | `load_ts`, `file_name`, `pipeline_name`, `pipeline_runid` | Metadata injected by the Data Pipeline — not in the source CSV |

### 2.2.2 CSV ingestion mapping (`DepositMovement_mapping`)

After the table is created, the script creates an **ingestion mapping** — a separate object attached to the table. Think of them as two distinct things inside the KQL database:

```
KQL Database: DepositMovement
├── Table: DepositMovement            ← holds the actual data (rows)
└── Mapping: DepositMovement_mapping  ← instructions for "how to load a CSV into this table"
```

The **table** defines *what* columns exist. The **mapping** defines *how* incoming CSV data maps to those columns. Without the mapping, the Copy activity (Workshop 04) wouldn't know which CSV column goes into which table column.

The mapping tells KQL **which CSV column position (ordinal) maps to which table column**. This is necessary because:

- **The source CSV files have only 12 data columns**, but the table has 16 (12 data + 4 system).
- **The 4 system columns** (`load_ts`, `file_name`, `pipeline_name`, `pipeline_runid`) don't exist in the CSV — they are **appended by the Data Pipeline's Copy Activity** (Workshop 04) using "Additional columns".
- The mapping ensures:
  - **Ordinals 0–11** → **data columns** (from the CSV file)
  - **Ordinals 12–15** → **system columns** (injected by the pipeline)

| Ordinal | Column | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0–11 | `Date` … `Total_Txn` | Data column | CSV file content |
| 12 | `load_ts` | System column | Pipeline expression `utcNow()` |
| 13 | `file_name` | System column | `$$FILEPATH` (source blob path) |
| 14 | `pipeline_name` | System column | `@pipeline().Pipeline` |
| 15 | `pipeline_runid` | System column | `@pipeline().RunId` |

Without this mapping, KQL would auto-infer column positions and types, causing the 4 system columns to fail silently or land in wrong columns.

The mapping is saved as `'DepositMovement_mapping'` — this name is referenced later in the Copy Activity sink configuration (Workshop 04).

**Verify both objects exist** by running these in the KQL query editor:

```kusto
// See the table schema
.show table DepositMovement schema as json

// See the mapping
.show table DepositMovement ingestion csv mappings
```

You should see `DepositMovement_mapping` listed with all 16 column mappings (ordinals 0–15).

### 2.2.3 Streaming ingestion policy

```
.alter-merge database DepositMovement policy streamingingestion '{ "IsEnabled": true }'
.alter table DepositMovement policy streamingingestion enable
```

By default, KQL uses **batched ingestion** which buffers rows for 1–5 minutes before they become queryable. Enabling **streaming ingestion** makes data available in **seconds**.

| | Batched (default) | Streaming (enabled) |
|---|---|---|
| **Latency** | 1–5 minutes | Seconds |
| **Use case** | Bulk historical loads | Real-time dashboards & alerts |

Two commands are needed because streaming must be enabled at both the **database level** (prerequisite) and the **table level**.

This is critical for the workshop — you want intraday deposit data to appear in Power BI and Activator alerts as soon as each 30-minute file is ingested.

### 2.2.4 Retention & caching policy

```
.alter table DepositMovement policy retention '{ "SoftDeletePeriod": "365.00:00:00", "Recoverability": "Enabled" }'
.alter table DepositMovement policy caching hot = 90d
```

These policies control **how long data lives** and **how fast queries run**:

| Policy | Setting | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Retention** | `SoftDeletePeriod: 365 days` | Data older than 1 year is auto-deleted. `Recoverability: Enabled` allows recovery within a grace period. |
| **Caching** | `hot = 90d` | Last 90 days kept in **hot cache** (SSD/RAM) for fast queries. Older data moves to **cold storage** (slower but still queryable). |

**Data lifecycle:**

```
Today ◄─── 90 days ───► Hot cache (fast queries)
       ◄── 365 days ──► Cold storage (slower, still accessible)
       Beyond 365 days → Deleted automatically
```

> 💡 **Tune to your needs** — for a workshop/POC, these defaults work well. In production, adjust based on query patterns and cost requirements.


1. Fabric workspace → **+ New item** → **Warehouse** → name it `wh_control_framework` → **Create**.
2. Once provisioned, open the Warehouse and click **New SQL query**.

## 2.4 Create the audit/control table (T-SQL)

This table acts as a **deduplication and audit log** for the Data Pipeline. Every time a CSV file is ingested, the pipeline writes a row here recording:
- **Which file** was processed (`FileName`)
- **When** it was ingested (`IngestedAtUtc`)
- **How many rows** were copied (`RowCount_`)
- **Whether it succeeded or failed** (`Status`)
- **Pipeline metadata** for traceability

Before ingesting a new file, the pipeline checks this table to see if the file has already been processed — preventing duplicate loads. If a run fails, the error message is captured in `ErrorMsg` for troubleshooting.

Paste and run the script:

- [sql/02-create-ProcessedFiles.sql](sql/02-create-ProcessedFiles.sql)

Schema:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FileName` | VARCHAR(260) | Natural key for dedup |
| `IngestedAtUtc` | DATETIME2(3) | When the row was written |
| `RowCount_` | BIGINT | Rows copied by the pipeline *(trailing `_` — `ROWCOUNT` is reserved in T-SQL)* |
| `Status` | VARCHAR(32) | `Success` / `Failed` / `Skipped-Duplicate` |
| `PipelineName` | VARCHAR(200) | `@pipeline().Pipeline` |
| `PipelineRunId` | VARCHAR(64) | `@pipeline().RunId` |
| `RunAsUser` | VARCHAR(200) | Trigger type + name |
| `ErrorMsg` | VARCHAR(4000) | Copy Activity error (if any) |

Verify:

```sql
SELECT TOP (1) * FROM dbo.ProcessedFiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Rows_ FROM dbo.ProcessedFiles;
```

## 2.5 Verify streaming ingestion is enabled

After running the script in step 2.2, streaming ingestion should already be enabled. Use these commands to **confirm** it was applied correctly:

In the KQL Database query pane:

```kusto
.show database DepositMovement policy streamingingestion
.show table DepositMovement policy streamingingestion
```

(Warehouses don't have a streaming-ingestion policy — writes via pipeline `Script` / `Stored procedure` activity are sufficient for a per-file audit row.)

## ✅ Exit Criteria

- [ ] Eventhouse + KQL Database `DepositMovement` exist, with the 16-column `DepositMovement` table + `DepositMovement_mapping`
- [ ] Streaming ingestion enabled on `DepositMovement`
- [ ] Warehouse `wh_control_framework` exists
- [ ] Table `dbo.ProcessedFiles` exists with 8 columns; empty `SELECT` returns no rows

## Appendix A — Lakehouse vs Warehouse vs Eventhouse

Microsoft Fabric offers three analytical storage engines. Understanding when to use each one is critical for designing the right architecture.

### What is each one?

| | **Lakehouse** | **Warehouse** | **Eventhouse** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What** | Delta Lake storage + Spark engine + SQL endpoint (read-only) | Full T-SQL data warehouse (read/write) | KQL-based real-time analytics database (Kusto engine) |
| **Engine** | Apache Spark (PySpark, Spark SQL) | T-SQL (SQL Server-compatible) | Kusto Query Language (KQL) |
| **Storage format** | Delta Parquet (open format) | Proprietary columnar | Columnar with compression + indexing optimized for append |
| **Query language** | Spark SQL, PySpark, T-SQL (read-only via SQL endpoint) | T-SQL (full DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) | KQL + limited T-SQL via `explain` (see Workshop 04, Appendix D) |
| **Data pattern** | Batch ETL, schema-on-read, medallion architecture | Star/snowflake schema, structured reporting | Append-only, time-series, streaming, log analytics |
| **Write pattern** | Spark notebooks, Data Pipelines, Dataflows | T-SQL INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, COPY INTO | Streaming ingestion, queued ingestion, Data Pipelines |
| **Update/Delete** | ✅ Via Spark (Delta merge) | ✅ Native T-SQL | ❌ Append-only (soft-delete via retention policy) |
| **Latency** | Minutes (batch) | Seconds–minutes | **Sub-second** to seconds (streaming) |
| **Best for** | Data engineers building ETL pipelines | BI analysts & SQL developers building reports | Real-time monitoring, IoT, log analytics, alerting |

### Use cases

| | **Lakehouse** | **Warehouse** | **Eventhouse** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Use case 1** | **Medallion architecture** — Bronze (raw CSV/JSON) → Silver (cleaned) → Gold (aggregated) | **Financial reporting** — monthly P&L, balance sheet, regulatory reports | **Intraday deposit monitoring** ← *this workshop* |
| **Use case 2** | **Data science** — ML feature engineering with PySpark notebooks | **Dashboard backend** — Power BI DirectQuery on star schema | **Fraud detection** — real-time transaction scoring |
| **Use case 3** | **Data lake consolidation** — store Parquet/CSV/JSON from multiple sources | **Control/audit tables** — `ProcessedFiles` ← *this workshop* | **IoT telemetry** — millions of sensor readings per second |
| **Use case 4** | **Cross-format joins** — join CSV files with Delta tables in Spark | **Ad-hoc SQL analysis** — business users write familiar SQL | **Log analytics** — application logs, security events, traces |
| **Use case 5** | **Historical archive** — years of transaction history in cheap storage | **Slowly changing dimensions** — customer/product master data | **Anomaly detection** — built-in `series_decompose_anomalies()` |

### Pros & Cons

**Lakehouse**

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| ✅ Open Delta format — no vendor lock-in | ❌ No real-time ingestion |
| ✅ Spark + SQL — flexible for both engineers and analysts | ❌ SQL endpoint is read-only |
| ✅ Best for large-scale ETL and data science | ❌ Spark startup overhead (cold start ~30s) |
| ✅ Cheapest storage for large volumes | ❌ Not suitable for low-latency queries |

**Warehouse**

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| ✅ Full T-SQL — familiar to SQL developers | ❌ Not designed for streaming/real-time |
| ✅ INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE | ❌ Slower ingestion than Eventhouse |
| ✅ Best for BI reporting and star schemas | ❌ No Spark/Python support |
| ✅ Power BI DirectQuery optimized | ❌ More expensive for large scan workloads |

**Eventhouse**

| Pros | Cons |
|---|---|
| ✅ Sub-second ingestion and query | ❌ Append-only — no UPDATE/DELETE |
| ✅ Built-in time-series functions | ❌ KQL learning curve (unfamiliar to SQL users) |
| ✅ Native streaming from Event Hub, Kafka | ❌ Not suitable for transactional/OLTP workloads |
| ✅ Built-in anomaly detection + alerting | ❌ No star schema / dimensional modeling |
| ✅ Automatic indexing — no manual tuning | ❌ Retention-based data lifecycle (not row-level delete) |

### In this workshop — why all three?

| Component | Storage | Why this engine |
|---|---|---|
| `DepositMovement` table | **Eventhouse** | Real-time intraday monitoring — fast ingestion, time-series queries, alerting |
| `ProcessedFiles` audit table | **Warehouse** | Control framework — needs INSERT (write), familiar SQL for ops teams |
| `Summary_Alert_Channel` Gold table | **Eventhouse** | Pre-aggregated for Power BI + Activator — stays close to the source data |
| *(Not used in this workshop)* | **Lakehouse** | Would be used if we needed historical archive or Spark-based ML on deposit patterns |

> 💡 **Rule of thumb:** **Eventhouse** for real-time, **Warehouse** for structured reporting & control, **Lakehouse** for big data ETL & data science.
